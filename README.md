# sms-spam-classifier project
This project implements an SMS Spam Classifier using NLP techniques. The classifier can distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) messages.
It utilizes a voting ensemble of three models: Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classifier, combined with TF-IDF Vectorizer for feature extraction.
Achieved 0.9874 accuracy and 1.0 precision with this technique. Also deploy the project on Heroku
